1. In the following code snippet, find all violations of the style guide.
Rewrite it so that it conforms with the guide.

let iceCreamTaste = 'chocolate';
let iceCreamDensity = 10;

while (iceCreamDensity > 0) {
  console.log('Drip...');
  iceCreamDensity -= 1;
}

console.log('The '+ iceCreamTaste + ' ice cream melted.');


2. Without looking into your notes, try to remember which primitive data types
  are defined in JavaScript. Then find this information on MDN.
Number
String
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Symbol

3. Using the documentation, determine how we can find the largest numeric value
  that can be represented in JavaScript. Write a line of code that returns this value.
Number.MAX_VALUE;

4. Find the MDN documentation on operator precedence, and use it to find out
  which result the expression 4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10 evaluates to.
The result will be 20.9. (4 * 5) + ((3 ** 2) / 10)

5. Find out what Date.now() returns.
The Date.now() method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since
January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

6. The MDN page for Date lists two methods to get the year of a date.
let today = new Date();

today.getYear();
today.getFullYear();

What is the difference between the two methods and which one should you use?
Date.getYear() - Returns the year (usually 2-3 digits) in the specified date according to local time.
Date.getFullYear() - Returns the year of the specified date according to local time.

Date.getFullYear() should be used.

7. How many arguments does the Array.prototype.join() method expect?
  What happens if you call it with less or more arguments?
Array.prototype.join() expects an argument being a string separator.
Omitting arguments will default to separating with a comma
Calling with additional arguments will be ignored.

8. Find out how we can join two or more strings together.
str.concat() method
using + operator

9. The below code raises a SyntaxError. If you run the code, you'll see the following error message:
SyntaxError: Unexpected token &&

Find and read the documentation about this error on MDN. Then, fix the code.

let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if ((currentSpeed > speedLimit) && ((currentSpeed - speedLimit) > 5)) {
  console.log('"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
    'that computers don\'t have to be that good to be much better." ' +
    '-- Marc Andreessen');
}

10. Run the following code.

let tweet = 'Woohoo! :-)';

if (tweet.length() > 140) {
  console.log('Tweet is too long!');
}

You'll see that it raises an error:

TypeError: tweet.length is not a function

Check the documentation of both TypeError and length, in order to find out
  what causes the error.
The error is being raised because length is not a function but a property of String.
